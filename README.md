# _Timelinio (*Prototype*)_

#### _A timeline visualization tool to help keep track of your life (or anything else), October 4th, 2016_

#### By _**Wolfgang Warneke**_

## Description

_This is a story all about how, my life got flipped, got turned into a timeline.  Several timelines, to compare and contrast the past, to learn and grow from it, etc, etc... This timeline utility will allow users to create custom timelines with custom events and custom focuses and eventually will be able to compare various timelines side by side to really get into that personal 'big data' everyone seems to be talking about._
_In the future (**the future, Conan?**), this whole app will have a sleekly attractive graphic user interface to actually visualize the timelines and events instead of the boring tabular data rubric currently in deploy.  The time will come soon enough.  (Current estimations are by **10.7.2016**!)_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Are you running Visual Studio 2015?_
* _Are you running SQL Server?_
* _Clone the project and open it in Visual Studio._
* _Wait for the packages to restore..._
* _Run it.  A database initializer will prepopulate an initial environment for you to mess around with!_
* _Enjoy and please do send any feedback my way!  I'd love to hear from you and I am eager to learn and improve!_

_(When the test user information is ready, I'll put it here)_
